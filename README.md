# ShellScripts

## download.sh
A collection of scripts to help you download the Linux and FreeBSD scripts from my github that help your setup a new desktop enverment, sudo or ssh.

## sshd.sh
Pass this script a user and it will set that user up with my public ssh key. Sets the ssh config to turn off root login and password authentication and enables and starts the ssh service.

## sudo_setup.sh
Pass this script a user and it will set that user up as sudo group and sets up the sudo group.
